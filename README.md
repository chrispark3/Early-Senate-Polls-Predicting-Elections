# Early Senate Polls Predicting Elections
 
An article published by the FiveThirtyEight was chosen to recreate its data graphics using its respective dataset. The article's title is "Early Senate Polls have Plenty to Tell Us About November (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/early-senate-polls-have-plenty-to-tell-us-about-november/).

Packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 in R were used to execute data visualization.

This small project was done to practice reproducing descriptive statistics using R.

### Summary of Article and its Data Graphics:

The first visual graphic shows early senate poll accuracy since 2006. This proves how early polls do a pretty good job of predicting the final vote margin. Therefore, the average error between the early polls are revealed. The president’s party’s candidate won 83% of the time he or she led in the early poll average and lost 88 percent of the time when he or she trailed.

The second visual graphic shows early presidential approval and senate outcomes. It displays how a president's approval rating isn't as strongly tied to the ultimate result. The data is much more scattered in this graphic compared to the first graphic. Therefore, the 58 races in the sample where the president's statewide approval rating was less than 43%, the president's party candidate lost. However, when a president's approval rating was greater than 43%, the president's candidate lost 35% of races. 

Ultimately, a president's approval rating is far from a perfect predictor of how Senate races will turn out. Polls are better predictors than presidential approval. however, implementing data form both will result in the best prediction.
